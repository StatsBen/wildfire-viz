# Fireviz

A front-end exploration and viz tool for sifting through 1.88million records of wildfires between 1992 and 2015.

## Run the App

run `npm install` in the top of the directory, then `npm run dev`.

## The Data

This viz is designed to run alongside my wildfire-server project (just serves up the data API-style from a SQLite database I downloaded from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires/version/1).

Make sure the server is also downloaded and running before starting or deploying this app - See more here: https://github.com/StatsBen/wildfire-viz
